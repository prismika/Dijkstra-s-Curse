This is Dijkstra's Curse, an ASCII-based rogue-like game. This iteration has multiple files, with an architecture consisting of four rough layers:

Layer 1: 	+dijkstrasCurse (parses CLI)
Layer 2: 	+mapBuilder (generates map)
			+mapPopulator (populates map with NPC's)
			+Display (handles output)
			+TurnMaster (Discrete event simulator)
			+mapIO (for writing and reading of map files)[ currently broken :( ]
Layer 3:	+map (defines Map type, which handles blocks and population locations)
Lower Level:+heap (Dr. Sheaffer's heap)
			+mapElements (stores map specs and defines types such as Block, BlockType, DistanceMap, etc.)
			+pathFinder (implements Dijkstra's algorithm and generates distance maps)
			+populationElements (defines types for characters such as Entity, etc.)

Usage:
./dijkstrasCurse
	Generates random dungeon and populates with monsters
./dijkstrasCurse --nummon x
	Generates dungeon and populates it with x monsters

I hope your semester is going well!
