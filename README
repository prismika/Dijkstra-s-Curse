This is Dijkstra's Curse, an ASCII-based rogue-like game. This iteration has multiple files, with an architecture consisting of four rough layers:

Layer 1: 	+dijkstrasCurse (parses CLI)

Layer 2: 	+mapBuilder (generates map)
			+mapPopulator (populates map with NPC's)
			+display (handles output)
			+turnMaster (Discrete event simulator)
			+mapIO (for writing and reading of map files)
			+inputCollector (for reading and cleaning user input)

Layer 3:	+map (defines Map type, which handles block and entity locations, as well as interfaces facilitating entity movement)

Lower Level:+heap (Dr. Sheaffer's heap)
			+mapElements (stores map specs and defines types such as Block, BlockType, DistanceMap, etc.)
			+pathFinder (implements Dijkstra's algorithm and generates distance maps)
			+populationElements (defines types for characters such as Entity, etc.)

Usage:
./dijkstrasCurse
	Generates random dungeon and populates with monsters
Flags:
--nummon x
	Populates each level with x monsters
--seed x
	Seeds the random number generator with seed x

Controls:
	Use the keypad to move your character. While on stairs, press '<' or '>' to access the next level. Pressing 'm' opens the monster list, which can be scrolled by using the up and down arrow keys. Pressing escape returns you to the map.
