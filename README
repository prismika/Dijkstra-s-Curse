This is Dijkstra's Curse, an ASCII-based rogue-like game. This iteration only has one file, dungeonGen.c.

Usage:
./dungeonGen
	Prints randomly generated dungeon along with the seed
./dungeonGen --save
	Same as with no arguments, except the dungeon is saved to ~/.rlg327/ under the name "dungeon," if the directory exists.
./dungeonGen --load
	Loads the dungeon at ~/.rlg327/dungeon if it exists, and displays it.
./dungeonGen --save --load
	Loads the dungeon at ~/.rlg327/dungeon, displays it, and saves it again.

Known bugs:
	The program performs fine on the "pixel art" maps that the instructor provided, except that a segfault occurs just before the program terminates. I expect this is because there are no stairs in those maps. Thankfully a map up to specs will have both up and down stairs.

Enjoy your Valentine's Day!
