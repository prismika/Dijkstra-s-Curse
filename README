This is the first iteration of Dijkstra's Curse, an ASCII-based rogue-like game. This iteration only has one file, dungeonGen.c, which compiles to form dungeonGen, a dungeon generator. When called with no arguments, dungeonGen chooses a random seed and prints both the seed and the resulting dungeon. You may instead elect to give dungeonGen an integer as an argument, which it will use as a custom seed. Either way, the result is a dungeon with 6 to 9 rooms of varying sizes, well-connected with corridors, with up and down staircases placed randomly. Rooms, maps, and blocks are all internally represented with structs, while block types are represented with an enum.
Hope your snow days were relaxing.
