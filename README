This is Dijkstra's Curse, an ASCII-based rogue-like game (now in C++!).

Usage:
./dijkstrasCurse
	Generates random dungeon and populates with monsters
Flags:
--seed x
	Seeds the random number generator with seed x

Controls:
	Use the keypad to move your character (make sure to turn on numlock). While on stairs, press '<' or '>' to access the next level. Pressing 'm' opens the monster list, which can be scrolled by using the up and down arrow keys. Pressing escape returns you to the map.

	(New!) Press t to switch to teleport mode. Move the cursor and press t again to teleport. Press r in teleport mode to teleport to a random open spot.


Architecture:
This iteration has multiple files, with an architecture consisting of four rough layers:

Layer 1: 	+dijkstrasCurse (parses CLI)
			+gameTypes (defines controller classes)

Layer 2: 	+mapBuilder (generates map)
			+mapPopulator (populates map with NPC's)
			+display (handles output)
			+turnMaster (Discrete event simulator)
			+mapIO (for writing and reading of map files)
			+inputCollector (for reading and cleaning user input)

Layer 3:	+map (defines Map type, which handles block and entity locations, as well as interfaces facilitating entity movement)

Lower Level:+heap (Dr. Sheaffer's heap)
			+mapElements (stores map specs and defines types such as Block, BlockType, DistanceMap, etc.)
			+pathFinder (implements Dijkstra's algorithm and generates distance maps)
			+populationElements (defines types for characters such as Entity, etc.)
