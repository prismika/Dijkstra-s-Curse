This is Dijkstra's Curse, an ASCII-based rogue-like game (now with custom monsters!). See the usage section for information on showcasing new functionality.

Usage:
./dijkstrasCurse
	Launches the game
Flags:
(NEW!)
--monsters
	Displays an atlas of monsters in the game
--seed x
	Seeds the random number generator with seed x

Architecture:
	This iteration has multiple files, with an architecture consisting of four rough layers:

	Layer 1: 	+dijkstrasCurse (parses CLI)
				+gameTypes (defines controller classes)

	Layer 2: 	+mapBuilder (generates map)
				+mapPopulator (populates map with NPC's)
				+display (handles output)
				+turnMaster (Discrete event simulator)
				+inputCollector (for reading and cleaning user input)
				+monsterParser (Loads monster blueprints from text file)

	Layer 3:	+map (defines Map type, which handles block and entity locations, as well as interfaces facilitating entity movement)

	Lower Level:+heap (Dr. Sheaffer's heap)
				+mapElements (stores map specs and defines types such as Block, BlockType, DistanceMap, etc.)
				+pathFinder (implements Dijkstra's algorithm and generates distance maps)
				+populationElements (defines types for characters such as Entity, etc.)
